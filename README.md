# Refactoring Legacy PHP

### The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how to refactor a legacy PHP codebase.

Each branch will demonstrate one of the steps.

#### Please note: I comment my code in this project much more verbosely than normal because I am making this project as a tutorial for the community.

## STEP_02
In this step we write more tests that fail then refactor the slugify function so it passes all the tests.
